# Snail Storage
A simple 200 line python based storage manager

Snail Storage is a simple storage manager that allows you to quickly figure out what is taking up space on any of your drives, and then delete it if you choose to do so. Its a single script, with UI through tinkit, and an option to restart the program as an admin just incase you need that.

While there is UI for everything, the terminal that opens up alongside it will show you what file is being scanned live, which is super handy in knowing if the program is frozen or not while scanning.
